# CRUD-Games_Store---DTI-DS-Purwadhika

This repository houses the project "CRUD Games_Store" developed for the Module 1 Capstone project in Data Science program at Purwadhika Digital Technology Incubator (DTI). The project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for managing a game store, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on game entries.

## Key Features:

- Create: Add new games to the store's inventory by specifying the console name, game name, and price.
- Read: View the list of available games and their details, such as name, price, and stock.
- Update: Edit existing game entries to modify their name or price, and update the stock levels.
- Delete: Remove games from the inventory that are no longer available or needed.
- Buy: Purchase games from the store by specifying the quantity desired, with real-time updates to stock levels.
- Payment: Calculate the total payment for purchased games and provide a mechanism for payment and change calculation.

## Development Environment:

- The project utilizes Python's Tkinter library for building the GUI components.
- It employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for efficient code organization and modularity.
- The CRUD functionality ensures seamless management of game entries within the store's inventory.
- The user-friendly interface enhances the overall user experience, making it intuitive to navigate and operate.
